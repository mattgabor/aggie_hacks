Mall App:

IDEAS FOR APP:

first get the image. Identify store - make store a node w/ opening and closing time, what it has
Make barriers (blocks) delays (30 seconds for escalator, 1 min for stairs)
xyz in the database, location and height

We probably want to manually add mall data in the beginning - computer vision is a lot more advanced
